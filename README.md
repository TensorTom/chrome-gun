# chrome-gun

If you like [gun](https://gun.eco) and [superPeer]("https://github.com/TensorTom/superPeer"), you're gonna love chrome-gun! Chrome-gun is a gun super-peer/gun node in a Chrome app.

## What & Why

In order to facilitate p2p gun networks, we use super-peers to help people who are behind tough-to-traverse
NAT routers and the like. A super peer is usually installed on a server but what if anyone could install
one with ease? What if a Chrome app could perform NAT traversal via hole-punching, facilitating mesh
topologies? Those reasons and more (Such as easier gun development) make chrome-gun super useful.

## Status

This doesn't work yet as I just started it. Check back soon though because I'm on the war path.

## To Install

Either:

1. Install on Chrome OS via the app store (Coming soon).

or

2. [Download directly] to install in your Chrome/Chromium browser.
